come rain or shine
paper over the cracks
on the up and up
third time lucky
run before you can walk
fly off the handle

fall on stony ground
have it easy
talk nineteen to the dozen
tread water
go under the hammer
reds under the bed
duke it out
a pretty penny
the grass is always greener
an Englishman's home is his castle
that makes two of us
flat as a pancake
in one ear and out the other
make your blood boil
different strokes for different folks
no rest for the wicked
pushing up the daisies
hold your tongue
before you can say Jack Robinson
by leaps and bounds
bite off more than you can chew
spit the dummy
too big for your boots
down and dirty
go down a storm
in your element
stick to your guns
wheels within wheels
close call
stubborn as a mule
right as rain
jump the track
rags to riches
save someone's bacon
keep your eyes peeled
have a foot in both camps
cut the crap
