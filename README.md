# Idiom Identification Using Natural Language Processing

## Overview
We created a system to identify idiomatic expressions in text. We utilise the MAGPIE corpus of Potentially Idiomatic Expressions as a training set to initially create a naive algorithm to identify idioms. Afterwards, we implemented modifications to the algorithm to ensure greater accuracy and precision in our system. We improved our system by adding additional permutations to our bank of idiomatic expressions, as a particular idiom may have different variations. Additionally, we also applied word vectorization to distinguish between potential idiomatic expressions with ambiguous and literal uses.
